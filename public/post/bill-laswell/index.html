<p>Bassists who have a problem with picking tend to hold one or both of the following beliefs: They don&rsquo;t like the sound: Picks produce a treble-heavy, defined sound. Although this sound compliments certain genres, some bassists are traditionalists, believing a pick takes away from an authentic sound.Jul 11, 2020</p>

<p>You can use a pick on your bass guitar if you want to. Both finger plucking and using picks are perfectly normal ways to play the bass guitar. You can find plenty of examples of famous bassists who use either technique, and there is no harm to using a pick.</p>

<p>Paul played with a pick from his earliest days on the instrument, and continued this habit all throughout his career. It&rsquo;s rare to find a Beatles where he plays with his fingers instead. Using a pick has a number of tonal advantages, particularly with the violin-style basses that Paul liked to use.Jul 15, 2020</p>

<p>Most metal bassists play by plucking the strings with their fingers or by picking with a plectrum, often known as a pick. Using a pick can enable bassists to play rapid repeated notes and fast basslines, although some bassists, such as Steve Harris and Steve DiGiorgio, play such basslines without the use of a plectrum.</p>

<p>So, do bassists use picks? Yes; bassists who perform fast-paced, aggressive-sounding music are more-likely to use picks. This is because picks produce a more treble-heavy and &lsquo;snappy&rsquo; sound than fingerstyle playing does.</p>

<p>Truthfully, there is no right or wrong way to play a bass guitar. There isn&rsquo;t even a preferred way. Any method you use to get sound out of the thing—fingers, pick, thumb, those weird stick things Tony Levin uses, telekinesis, whatever—works just fine. It&rsquo;s purely a matter of personal preference.</p>

<p>Some bassists claim they never use picks. They stand by the adage that bass players should be able to produce any sound needed…by plucking the strings. But the reality is that picks have been used extensively by bassists since the bass guitar was invented several decades ago.</p>

<p>I get the most sounds with a medium; my main pick is a . 73 Dunlop Tortex. In general, tortoiseshell picks are the closest thing to the sound of fingernails, and that&rsquo;s why people use them on acoustics—they have more articulation, and they open up better.Jan 8, 2020</p>

<p>Paul McCartney, Chris Squire, Roger Glover, Mike Dirnt, Matt Freeman and many others are admired for their powerful pick playing. Plenty of bassists use both methods—John Entwistle, John Paul Jones, Sting, Roger Waters and Adam Clayton all leap to mind.</p>

<p>Place your thumb on the face (not on top) of your pickup closest to the neck. Let your thumb linger just above the E-string. You will see why shortly. On most bass guitars this should put your plucking fingers in a central position between the neck and the bridge.</p>

<p>Bass players generally use thicker picks. The thickness improves the bass playing control, and the overall tone of the string. The average pick thickness for bass players is 1.17 mm, while for guitar players is 0.89 mm. Remember, bass strings are much thicker than guitar strings.</p>
