<p>Alex Al, Jackson&rsquo;s bassist since 2001 and a member of the seven-piece band featured in the film, concurs. “Bass was the most important instrument to him. He&rsquo;d make references to Paul McCartney&rsquo;s melodic playing with the Beatles, James Jamerson being upfront and center with Motown, or Stevie Wonder&rsquo;s left hand.”Jan 8, 2020</p>
