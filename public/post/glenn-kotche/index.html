<p>Helmet broke up and basically it was a really bad break up. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I wanted to get into another band, but not right away. There weren&rsquo;t really any [new gigs] popping up and from a combination of that and just wanting to take some time off, I accidentally turned into a DJ.Jan 22, 2004</p>
