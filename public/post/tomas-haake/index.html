<p>Dave Weckl was the first one I heard of these guys, and I had this floppy 45” of him playing when I was about 14, 15. It just blew my mind. The stuff that he was doing was unlike anything I had ever heard before. And his sense of time and rhythm was a huge influence on the band that Meshuggah came to be.”Oct 30, 2016</p>
