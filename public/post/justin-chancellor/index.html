<p>Bassists who have a problem with picking tend to hold one or both of the following beliefs: They don&rsquo;t like the sound: Picks produce a treble-heavy, defined sound. Although this sound compliments certain genres, some bassists are traditionalists, believing a pick takes away from an authentic sound.Jul 11, 2020</p>

<p>Truthfully, there is no right or wrong way to play a bass guitar. There isn&rsquo;t even a preferred way. Any method you use to get sound out of the thing—fingers, pick, thumb, those weird stick things Tony Levin uses, telekinesis, whatever—works just fine. It&rsquo;s purely a matter of personal preference.</p>

<p>There is no denying that some people find using a pick easier, especially to start or if they have played guitar before. There is less in the way of coordination required and it is sometimes faster to learn. Don&rsquo;t just choose based on what you think will be easiest. Instead, think about what is going to sound best.</p>
