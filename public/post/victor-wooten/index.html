<p>As a producer, Wooten knows how to engage listeners and make things fun, so he had his friend Michael Winslow, the “voicetrumentalist” comedian best known as Larvelle Jones from the seven Police Academy movies, add a tastefully surreal dimension to several tracks on the album.</p>

<p>Victor Wooten plays a 4, 5, 6 and fretless basses. I saw him at a bass clinic and he told me he feels more comfortable on a 4 doing the &ldquo;circus&rdquo; bass stuff but will play what is required for the gig. A 5 string bass has no more complexity than a 4 string bass.Sep 14, 2016</p>
