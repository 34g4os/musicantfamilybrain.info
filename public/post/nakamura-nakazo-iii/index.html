<p>He always spoke Japanese to me, so one day I asked him to speak English, and he told me (in Japanese) that he couldn&rsquo;t speak English. He said that he memorized his English lines by the sounds of the words.</p>

<p>In the end, Mifune and Kurosawa did reportedly reconcile their personal relationship in the early 1990s. Although Kurosawa was instrumental in launching and nurturing Mifune&rsquo;s career, the actor had a very successful career also outside of the director&rsquo;s films, appearing in altogether close to 200 films.Apr 1, 2015</p>

<p>Galbraith&rsquo;s is that for Mifune &ldquo;the artistic benefits of working with Kurosawa were outweighed by the overwhelming business concerns that constantly plagued him&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Kurosawa felt betrayed and refused to understand how the actor could appear in inferior films.&ldquo;Mar 10, 2002</p>

<p>Galbraith gives an alternate reason for Mifune&rsquo;s not appearing &ndash; that the producers found him too expensive. Whatever the reason, the break marked the beginning of the gradual decline of both men.Mar 10, 2002</p>
